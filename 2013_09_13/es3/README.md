# Exercise 3
Given a directory, print the total number of characters(sum of the number of characters for each line) that appear on every single line.
For example:
```
$es3.py mydir
1 234
2 21
3 333
...
```
means that there are a total of 234 characters in the first rows, 21 characters in all the second rows, 333 characters in all the third rows, etc. inside the "mydir" directory
