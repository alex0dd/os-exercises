#Exercise 3
Given a directory, output a file that will contain all the lengths and names of the files contained in the given directory, one file entry per output file row
For example(if dirname contains two files):
```
mytx.py dirname
```
will output a file called dirname.t2 with the following content:
```
12 file1
235 file2
```
